                    <p>The ILOVEYOU virus was a computer worm that began spreading in May 2000. Originating from the Philippines, it was distributed through email with the subject "ILOVEYOU" and an attachment that appeared to be a love letter. Once opened, the worm overwrote important files and automatically sent itself to everyone in the victim’s email contacts. It spread rapidly across the world within hours, affecting millions of computers. The worm caused approximately $10 billion in damages globally. It prompted a global conversation about email security and safe computing practices. The creators were not prosecuted due to the lack of applicable laws in the Philippines at that time.</p>

                    <h4 class="font-medium text-2xl text-indigo-600">Method of Attack</h4>
                    <p>The worm was disguised as a .TXT file, but it was actually a malicious Visual Basic Script (.VBS) file. When the attachment was opened, it overwrite files, stole passwords, and spread by emailing itself to all contacts. The attack relied heavily on human error, exploiting curiosity and trust. It did not need advanced exploits or vulnerabilities, only user interaction. This simplicity made it one of the most devastating social engineering attacks ever.The worm was disguised as a .TXT file, but it was actually a malicious Visual Basic Script (.VBS) file.

                            <p>Government offices, including the Pentagon and British Parliament, were forced to shut down email systems. Critical communications were disrupted for days as a result of the virus. The operational downtime cost millions in lost productivity.</p>

                            <p>Corporations suffered major financial losses due to the need for extensive system cleaning and recovery. Many had to wipe and rebuild entire networks to ensure the worm was eradicated. This also led to unexpected budget increases for cybersecurity resources.</p>

                            <h6 class="font-medium text-lg">Impact 3</h6>
                            <p>The ILOVEYOU virus triggered a major public awareness campaign about email security. Users became more cautious about opening email attachments from unknown senders. It also pushed software companies to improve file-type handling and email scanning technologies.</p>

                            <p>The virus revealed serious gaps in international cybercrime law enforcement. Philippine authorities could not prosecute the creators initially due to the lack of applicable legislation. This spurred the development of new cybercrime laws globally.</p>
