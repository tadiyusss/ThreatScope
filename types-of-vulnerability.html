          <p class="my-2">A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack occurs when a malicious actor intercepts communication between two parties without their knowledge. This eavesdropping allows the attacker to secretly relay or alter the communication, making it appear as though the legitimate exchange is still occurring directly between the intended participants.</p>
